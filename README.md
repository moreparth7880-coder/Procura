# 🛠️ Features of the App

The application consists of **four key modules**, each designed to address specific supply chain challenges.

---

## 1️⃣ Demand Forecasting using LSTM

### 📌 What does it do?

- Uses an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network to forecast future demand.
- Allows users to select a specific **SKU** and generate a **one-year demand forecast**.
- Helps businesses anticipate future sales trends and improve planning.

### ⚙️ How does it work?

- Preprocesses historical sales data.
- Removes non-stationarity and smooths demand fluctuations.
- Uses an **80%-20% train-test split** for validation.
- Trains an LSTM model to learn historical demand patterns.

### 📊 Output

- Interactive demand forecast visualization.
- Historical vs predicted demand comparison.
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** for accuracy evaluation.
- Downloadable forecast results.

## 2️⃣ Inventory Optimisation & Simulation

### 📌 What does it do?

Provides inventory planning support using:

- **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)** – Determines the optimal order quantity.
- **Safety Stock Calculation** – Prevents stockouts and service disruptions.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation** – Models demand uncertainty and risk.

### ⚙️ How does it work?

- Users select an SKU.
- Inventory parameters are calculated automatically.
- Generates **1000+ simulated demand scenarios** using random sampling techniques.

### 📊 Output

- EOQ and Safety Stock tables.
- Demand distribution plots.
- Interactive inventory risk analysis visualizations.

## 3️⃣ Customer & Product Segmentation

### 📌 What does it do?

Provides insights into customer and product performance.

Users can explore:

- **Sales by Supplier**
- **Sales by Product Family**
- **Sales by Product Category**
- **Top & Bottom Customers**
- **Stock Turnover Analysis**

### ⚙️ How does it work?

- Aggregates sales and revenue metrics.
- Calculates inventory turnover ratios.
- Visualizes supplier, customer, and product performance using interactive charts.

### 📊 Output

- Top and bottom 20 products by sales.
- Stock turnover rankings.
- Supplier performance dashboards.
- Customer segmentation reports.

---

## 4️⃣ Statistical Hypothesis Testing

### 📌 What does it do?

Performs statistical tests to validate important supply chain assumptions.

### 🔬 Available Tests

#### 1. Stockouts Reduce Sales
- Pearson Correlation between stock levels and sales.

#### 2. Longer Lead Times Lower Sales
- Linear Regression between lead time and sales.

#### 3. Supplier Revenue Differs Significantly
- Kruskal-Wallis Test across suppliers.

#### 4. Frequent Buyers Generate More Revenue
- Spearman Correlation between purchase frequency and revenue.

#### 5. Certain Product Categories Generate Higher Revenue
- ANOVA Test across product categories.

### ⚙️ How does it work?

- Users select a hypothesis from a dropdown menu.
- Statistical calculations are performed automatically.
- Test distributions and rejection regions are visualized.

### 📊 Output

- Test statistics.
- P-values.
- Accept/Reject decision for the null hypothesis.
- Graphical interpretation of results.
